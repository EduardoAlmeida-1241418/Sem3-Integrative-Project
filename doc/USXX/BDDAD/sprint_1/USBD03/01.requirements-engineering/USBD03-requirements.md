# USBD03 - Instantiate Relational Model with SQL DDL

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

> **As a** Product Owner, **I want** the relational model to be instantiated using SQL DDL generated by Visual Paradigm, **So that** a functional database is created.

### 1.2 Acceptance Criteria

- Scenario 1 – Database creation from the relational model

  > **Given** that the logical relational model (ERD) from USBD02 has been validated,
  >
  > **And** the SQL DDL script has been generated and reviewed in Visual Paradigm,
  >
  > **And** access to Oracle LiveSQL is confirmed,
  >
  > **When** the team executes the generated DDL script on Oracle LiveSQL,
  >
  > **Then** the database must be successfully created,
  >
  > **Then** all tables, constraints, and relationships must match the logical model defined in USBD02,
  >
  > **Then** the execution script must be stored in the `/sql-scripts/` directory of the repository,
  >
  > **So that** a fully functional database is available for further testing and data insertion.

### 1.3 Found out Dependencies
>This User Story depends on USBD02 (Logical Relational Model).

### 1.4 Input and Output Data
>**Input**
>
>- SQL DDL script generated from Visual Paradigm.
>
>**Output**
>
>- Functional Oracle LiveSQL database instance.
>- Execution script saved in `/sql-scripts/`.

### 1.5 Other Relevant Remarks
>**(i) Special requirements:**
>
>- Ensure compatibility with Oracle syntax.
>
>**(ii) How often this US is held:**
>
>- Executed once when moving from design to implementation phase.
